# what are microservices 
- in microservices architecture , each micsroservices owns a simple task and communicates with clients or other microservices by using lightweight communication mechanism such as REST APU request
- microservices are used to design and application that is
      - multilingual
      - loosely coupled with other services
      - easy to maintain and independently deployable
      - easily scalable and highly available
      - failures resistant

# Design methodology of microservices 
 12 factor methodology for developing microservice based applications 
1. codebase
2. dependencies
3. configuration
4. backing services
5. build , release and run
6. processes
7. port binding
8. concurrency
9. desposability
10. development and production parity
11. logs
12. admin processes

# Microservices design : benefits 
1. easier to build and maintain apps
2. oragnized around bisuness capabilities
3. improved productivity and speed of deployment
4. increased fault tolerance and fault isolation
5. greater scalability and flexibility
6. simplified security monitoring
7. autonomous , crosss functional teams

# Microservices design : drawbacks
1. more complex
2. more expensive then monoliths
3. require cultural changes
4. present harder debugging problems
5. global testing is difficult

# Introduction to containerization ?

# what is containerization ?
- with containerization , create a unified software packages (container)
- this technique brings virutlization at the operating system level
- container engine serves as the runtime environment
- containers shared the host os and hold only application and realted binaries
- containerized applications seamlessly run on various devices and os

# How it is different from virtualization ?

- continerization reduces startup overhead and eliminates the need for individual guest os setup by sharing the same os kernel
- it efficiently packages microservies enhancing resource use and enabling agile deployments

# benefits of containerization 
1. it provides portability
2. agility
3. speed
4. fault isolation
5. efficiency
6. ease of management
7. security
